## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned Tailwind in practive and this is... very difficult I don't like this but with this css helper i lern about flex, flexbox and images and yours classes. I feel like it makes no sense what are variables in css hehe

I see too Vite and I have nothing to say about.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div className="text-left rounded-full md:w-[600px] h-[450px] md:flex">
```
```css
.image {
  object-fit: cover; <--
}
```
